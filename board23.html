                <h2>Ishan Roshan(President)</h2>
                <p>Though he may seem quiet and self-reserved at first, Ishan is quite the cheery individual,
                    has a great sense of humor and is a great leader too. Having great decision capabilities, fantastic
                    organisational skills and an open-mind, he has helped the club accomplish great things, earning a
                    high
                    reputation for the club. Aside from his official duties, Ishan is an avid gamer and a foodie, having
                    earned
                    himself a reputation for being an exceptional League of Legends player among his peers. He is
                    currently pursuing his BTech in Computer Science and Engineering. Without him, we don't know where
                    we'd be!

                <h2>Arhaan Walia(Vice-President)</h2>
                <p>With great power, comes great tom-foolery. Currently pursuing his BTech in Computer Science and
                    Engineering, Arhaan
                    is a very outgoing person and a fun person to be around, and will cause a little trouble here and
                    there, whenever
                    he can. Currently serving as the Vice-President, Arhaan has played a pivotal role in the steering of
                    the huge ship
                    which we know as The Otaku Club VIT. Along with the President, Arhaan monitors whatever happens
                    within the club and
                    keeps the peace and harmony around here (kind of ironic). He is a thinker
                    and comes up with great ideas and plans of action, making him super reliable when in need.

                    a pivotal role in maintaining good relations within the board and within the club. He, along with the executive board,
                    plays a key role in making decisions and guiding the club in the righ direction, setting workflow plans for every month,
                    planning activities, putting out important messages and also, keeping a record of what happens within the club. He is a man
                    who is extremely proud of his culture and can be seen at many cultural events with his peers. Just know, we will never get tired of that
                    smile.

                <h2>Rishabhraj Srivastava(Co-Secretary)</h2>
                <p>Rishabhraj is by far the most active person we have in this club. Ever since he joined, he has shown immense
                    interest and enthusiasm in whatever he does. Rishabhraj has played an important role in many of the different
                    workflows in the club, having a high level of dedication in whatever he does, and most of all, great leadership and
                    people skills. Most recently, he is the in-charge of Otaku Monthly aand ensures that quiality content is published every 
                    month on the portal. Rishabhraj is joyous by nature, making friends wherever he goes and can at times, be a handful. 
                    Without Rishabhraj, this club would be lacking in a lot of things.

                <p>Hvaing a keen interest in Statistics and Python, Hari is an analytical individual who thinks twice before making any 
                    decisions. He has a unique perspective on how things should be done and feels that work should be done smartly whenever
                    possible. Super handy with a tablet and stylus, Hari's artistic side knows no bounds and the artworks which he has made independently 
                    and for the club show us proof of that. He is a fun person to be around and knows how to have a good time. Having been a member of the club since its
                    beginning, he shows great diligence in the duties he carries out.

                    but is ready to talk to anyone who approaches him. He has a huge liking for dogs and will pet one if he ever sees
                    one, abandoning whatever he was doing earlier. Anurag handles the image of our club and our relations with other clubs in 
                    VIT, with bigger organisations and is responsible for the outreach and engagement of our club's social media handles.
